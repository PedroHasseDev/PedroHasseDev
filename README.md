- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedro Hasse Niemczewski, a full stack web developer in training from Brazil, full focused on studying and improving my code. I love to create, and that's why I chose to be a developer. I'm a perfectionist, so I'll always strive to lay down the best work I'm currently capable of. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the first steps of being a Developer
- 👀 I’m interested in Front and Back-End, still working on what I'll focus in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with other people that want to learn as well, so feel free to talk to me!
- 📫 How to reach me? Just send a message! https://www.instagram.com/pedrohasseniem/?hl=pt-br
